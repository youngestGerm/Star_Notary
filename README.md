Steps to run and test project:

1. Change directory to project folder on terminal, cd app. 
2. Copy and paste url into web browser. This is the front end.
3. Open up new terminal. Change directory to project folder.
4. Run truffle develop, to get addresses. I may have gotten different addresses than you. If this is the case, I will need to redo the code in the test files, so that it is more generic. I'm not sure if the addresses provided change depending on the computer.
5. Run truffle test.
